  * **Media Queries:** Use your browser's developer tools (F12) to toggle between different device views (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).  
  * **Navigation:** The navigation menu should be usable on mobile, perhaps collapsing into a "hamburger" menu.

\</details\>

\<details\>

  2. Run npm install and then node index.js (or the main server file).  
  3. Use an API client like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or curl to test the endpoints.  
* **‚úÖ What to Check:**  
  * **CRUD Operations:** Test the GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE endpoints to ensure they perform the correct actions on the data.  
  * **Status Codes:** The API should return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found).

\</details\>

\<details\>
